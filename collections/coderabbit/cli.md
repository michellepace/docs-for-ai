## Review local changes

The CodeRabbit CLI analyzes local Git changes using the same pattern recognition that powers our PR reviews. By default, it reviews tracked changes: committed changes, staged changes (including new files added with `git add`), and unstaged edits to tracked files. Use `--uncommitted` to review only staged and tracked local edits. Files not added to Git are skipped unless you pass `--include-untracked`.

```bash theme={null}
coderabbit review                       # Tracked changes
coderabbit review --committed           # Only committed changes
coderabbit review --uncommitted         # Staged and tracked local edits
coderabbit review --include-untracked    # Also review files not added to Git
```

## Getting started

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install CLI">
    Download and install the CodeRabbit CLI using your preferred method.

    <CodeGroup>
      ```bash Installation script theme={null}
      curl -fsSL https://cli.coderabbit.ai/install.sh | sh
      ```

      ```bash Homebrew theme={null}
      brew install coderabbit
      ```
    </CodeGroup>

    After installation, restart your shell or reload your shell configuration:

    ```bash theme={null}
    source ~/.zshrc
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Authenticate">
    Link your CodeRabbit account to enable personalized reviews based on your team's patterns.

    ```bash theme={null}
    # cr is the short alias for coderabbit — both work identically
    cr auth login
    ```

    A browser window opens automatically. Sign in to CodeRabbit and the authentication completes in the browser.

    If your account has access to multiple CodeRabbit organizations, choose your default organization during sign-in. That choice sets the login/default org for browser-based auth, but CLI reviews still resolve the current repository first. You can change the default later with `cr auth org`.

    If browser sign-in is blocked or unavailable, authenticate with an Agentic API key instead:

    ```bash theme={null}
    cr auth login --api-key "cr-************"
    ```

    API-key authentication uses the key's organization and is also the recommended flow for headless or bot-driven environments. Reviews use the assigned user's plan allowance first, then usage credits only for eligible over-limit reviews when the usage-based add-on is enabled.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Review your code">
    Analyze your Git repository for issues using the CodeRabbit CLI.

    <Info>
      **Git repository required**: The CLI must be run from within an initialized Git repository. The `--dir` flag changes the review directory, but that directory must also contain a Git repository.
    </Info>

    ```bash wrap theme={null}
    cr
    ```

    If your main branch is not `main`, specify your base branch:

    ```bash theme={null}
    cr --base develop
    # or for other base branches
    cr --base master
    ```

    CodeRabbit scans the selected Git changes and provides specific feedback with suggested fixes.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Verify local setup">
    If setup, authentication, or review startup fails, run the local diagnostics command:

    ```bash theme={null}
    cr doctor
    ```

    The command checks installation, local storage, authentication, Git repository state, and CodeRabbit service connectivity.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Apply suggestions">
    Review findings in your terminal and either apply quick fixes or send complex issues to your AI coding agent.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Organization selection

The active CodeRabbit organization is the login/default org for browser-based CLI auth. It is used when the current repository resolves to that org, but it is not a silent billing fallback for unrelated local repositories.

During a review, CodeRabbit resolves the current repository first:

* If the repository matches the selected org, the review uses that org.
* If the repository matches a different org you can access, CodeRabbit switches attribution to that org.
* If the repository matches an installed public repo but you do not have access to the owning org, the review uses OSS behavior.
* If the repository cannot be matched to an installed accessible repo, the CLI falls back to limited/free review behavior until CodeRabbit is installed for that repo or org.

To change organizations later, run:

```bash theme={null}
cr auth org
```

`cr auth org` opens sign-in automatically if your local session is missing or expired. Organization switching is not available for self-hosted mode or API key authentication.

## Review modes

The CLI uses plain-text, human-readable output by default, with agent output and an optional lighter policy also available:

```bash theme={null}
# Default mode - detailed plain-text feedback with fix suggestions
coderabbit review

# Agent mode - structured JSON output for Skills and agent integrations
cr --agent

# Faster local review policy
cr review --light
```

The default plain-text mode displays a finding count and severity summary at the end of each run. No output flag is required. If the CLI detects a known agent environment, it suggests re-running with `--agent` for structured JSON output.

## Diagnostics

Run `cr doctor` at any time to verify your local setup. The command checks:

* CLI runtime and version
* Local CodeRabbit storage directory
* Authentication state and auth environment
* Current Git repository and branch metadata
* Auto-update policy
* CodeRabbit backend reachability
* CodeRabbit WebSocket reachability

```bash theme={null}
cr doctor
```

`cr doctor` exits with status code `1` when any check fails. Warnings appear in the report but do not cause a non-zero exit code.

## Review statistics

Use `cr stats` to inspect your review statistics from local review history:

```bash theme={null}
# Show stats (builds on first run)
cr stats

# Rebuild stats by rescanning review history
cr stats --rebuild
```

## Working with review results

CodeRabbit analyzes your code and surfaces specific issues with actionable suggestions. Each finding includes the problem location, explanation, and recommended fix.

Example findings include:

* **Race condition detected**: "This goroutine accesses shared state without proper locking"
* **Memory leak potential**: "Stream not closed in error path - consider using defer"
* **Security vulnerability**: "SQL query uses string concatenation - switch to parameterized queries"
* **Logic error**: "Function returns nil without checking error condition first"

### Browse and apply suggestions

In plain mode, read each finding in the terminal output and apply the suggested change in your editor or coding agent.

For simple issues like missing imports, syntax errors, or formatting problems, use the suggested fix directly. For larger changes, use `cr review --agent` so your coding agent can consume structured findings.

### Use AI coding agents

For AI agent integration, see the [AI agent integration](#ai-agent-integration) section for detailed workflow guidance and integration guides.

### Replay stored findings

Run `cr review findings` to re-read the results from the most recent local review without re-running the full analysis. This is useful in multi-step agent loops where a downstream step needs to consume results from a prior review.

### Inspect AI prompts

Run `cr review --show-prompts` to print the AI prompts saved from the most recent local review without triggering a new review. Useful for tuning `--config` instructions or understanding why the model flagged a particular finding.

## AI agent integration

CodeRabbit detects the problems, then your AI coding agent implements the fixes.

<Info>
  **Claude Code users**: Claude Code now supports CodeRabbit through a native
  plugin. See the [Claude Code integration guide](/cli/claude-code-integration)
  for the recommended plugin-based setup using `/coderabbit:review` instead of
  the CLI commands shown below.

### Example prompt for your AI agent

Here's a complete prompt you can use with Cursor, Codex, or other AI coding agents:

```text Sample prompt wrap theme={null}
Please implement phase 7.3 of the planning doc and then run cr --agent, let it run as long as it needs (run it in the background) and fix any issues.
```

### Components of a good prompt

Breaking down what makes an effective CodeRabbit + AI agent workflow:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="1. Run CodeRabbit CLI">
    Tell your AI agent to run CodeRabbit with the `--agent` flag:

    ```bash theme={null}
    cr --agent
    ```

    You can also specify a review scope or base branch:

    ```bash theme={null}
    # Review staged and tracked local edits
    cr review --agent --uncommitted

    # With specific base branch
    cr --agent --base develop
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="2. Run in the background">
    CodeRabbit reviews can take 7-30+ minutes depending on the scope of changes. Instruct your AI agent to run CodeRabbit in the background and set up a timer to check periodically:

    ```text Prompt wrap theme={null}
    Run cr review --agent --uncommitted in the background, let it take as long as it needs, and check on it periodically.
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="3. Evaluate and implement fixes">
    Once CodeRabbit completes, have your AI agent evaluate the findings and prioritize:

    ```text Prompt wrap theme={null}
    Evaluate the fixes and considerations. Fix major issues only, or fix any critical issues and ignore the nits.
    ```

    This keeps your agent focused on meaningful improvements rather than minor style issues. If the `complete` event has `status: "review_skipped"`, there were no file changes in scope.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="4. Verify with a second pass">
    Run CodeRabbit one more time to ensure fixes didn't introduce new issues:

    ```text Prompt wrap theme={null}
    Once those changes are implemented, run cr --agent one more time to make sure we addressed all the critical issues and didn't introduce any additional bugs.
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="5. Set loop limits">
    Prevent infinite iteration by setting clear completion criteria:

    ```text Prompt wrap theme={null}
    Only run the loop twice. If on the second run you don't find any critical issues, ignore the nits and you're complete. Give me a summary of everything that was completed and why.
    ```

    This ensures your AI agent completes the task efficiently and provides a clear report.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Pricing and capabilities

See the [rate limits table on the Plans and pricing page](/management/plans#rate-limits) for current per-plan limits. To increase the limits, consider upgrading your plan or using the [Usage-based Add-on](#cli-with-usage-based-add-on).

<CardGroup cols={1}>

  </Card>
</CardGroup>

Contact [sales@coderabbit.ai](mailto:sales@coderabbit.ai) for custom rate limits or enterprise needs.

## CLI with Usage-based Add-on

The usage-based add-on lets eligible CodeRabbit CLI reviews continue after the applicable review limit is reached. Authenticated CLI and agentic API-key reviews use the assigned user's plan allowance first. Credits are charged only when a review continues over that limit. Each reviewed file in the over-limit review costs **\$0.25** in credits. You can purchase credits as a one-time top-up or a recurring monthly subscription from the [Subscription and Billing](https://app.coderabbit.ai/settings/subscription) dashboard.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Enable the add-on and buy credits">
    Go to **[Subscription and Billing](https://app.coderabbit.ai/settings/subscription)** and open the **Usage-based add-on** tab to enable pay-as-you-go and purchase credits.

    For full setup details, see [Manage your subscription](/management/usage-based-addon).
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create an Agentic API key">
    Navigate to the [API Keys](https://app.coderabbit.ai/settings/api-keys) section and generate your **Agentic API key**. The key should be used by a user with an assigned CodeRabbit seat so CLI reviews can use the seat allowance first and usage credits only after the review is rate-limited.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Authenticate with your API key">
    You can pass `--api-key KEY` to any command directly, but if you plan to make multiple calls, it is more convenient to authenticate once with your CodeRabbit API key:

    ```bash theme={null}
    coderabbit auth login --api-key "cr-************"
    ```

    For GitHub Actions and other non-interactive environments, see [Headless CLI integration](/cli/headless-cli-integration).
  </Step>

  <Step title="Run a CodeRabbit review">
    After logging in, prompt your agent to run a CodeRabbit CLI review without passing the API key again:

    ```bash theme={null}
    coderabbit review
    ```

    If plan allowance is available, no usage credits are consumed. If the review is rate-limited, the add-on can continue the review only when pay-as-you-go is enabled, credits are available, and the review is attributed to an assigned-seat user.
  </Step>
</Steps>
