# Vercel Plugin for AI Coding Agents

The Vercel plugin gives [supported AI coding tools](#supported-tools) Vercel-specific context, skills, agents, and slash commands. The default installation keeps automation lightweight and activates session-start context only in empty directories and detected Vercel or Next.js projects.

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

- [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code), [OpenAI Codex](https://openai.com/codex), [Grok Build](https://x.ai/news/grok-build-cli), [Cursor](https://www.cursor.com), [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot), or [Kimi Code](https://kimi.com)
- Node.js 18 or later
- [Bun](https://bun.sh)

### Installation

```bash
npx plugins add vercel/vercel-plugin
```

The plugin installs Vercel context, skills, and a lightweight default hook profile.

### Usage

After installation, session context is injected automatically only for empty directories and detected Vercel or Next.js projects. You can invoke skills and commands directly when you want targeted guidance:

```text
/vercel-plugin:nextjs
/vercel-plugin:ai-sdk
/vercel-plugin:deploy prod
```

## What the plugin provides

| Component               | Description                                                                                                                                    |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Ecosystem graph**     | A relational knowledge graph covering every Vercel product, library, CLI, API, and service, with decision matrices and cross-product workflows |
| **[28 skills](#available-skills)**           | Deep-dive guidance for specific Vercel products, libraries, and workflows                                                                      |
| **3 specialist agents** | Purpose-built agents for deployment, performance optimization, and AI architecture                                                             |
| **5 slash commands**    | Quick actions for deploying, managing environment variables, bootstrapping projects, and more                                                  |

## Supported tools

| Tool                                                          | Status      |
| ------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------- |
| [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) | Supported   |
| [OpenAI Codex](https://openai.com/codex)               | Supported   |
| [Grok Build](https://x.ai/news/grok-build-cli)                 | Supported   |
| [Cursor](https://www.cursor.com)                              | Supported   |
| [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot)          | Supported   |
| [Kimi Code](https://kimi.com)                                  | Supported   |

## How it works

After installation, the plugin keeps automatic behavior lightweight. Session-start activation runs only in empty directories and detected Vercel or Next.js projects, and Vercel skills are not auto-injected on every prompt or every tool call by default.

The skills remain available on demand, and the plugin includes the injection engine for targeted or future opt-in workflows.

### Default hooks

- **Session start context injection**: Injects a thin Vercel session context plus `knowledge-update` guidance for empty directories and detected Vercel or Next.js projects
- **Session start repo profiler**: Scans config files and dependencies to set likely-skill hints after the same activation check passes

## Available skills

The plugin includes 28 skills covering the Vercel ecosystem:

## Slash commands

Use slash commands directly in your AI coding tool:

| Command                      | Purpose                                                           |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `/vercel-plugin:bootstrap`   | Bootstrap a project with linking, env provisioning, and db setup  |
| `/vercel-plugin:deploy`      | Deploy to Vercel (preview or production)                          |
| `/vercel-plugin:env`         | Manage environment variables (list, pull, add, remove, diff)      |
| `/vercel-plugin:status`      | View project status, recent deployments, and environment overview |
| `/vercel-plugin:marketplace` | Discover and install Vercel Marketplace integrations              |

To deploy to production, pass `prod` as an argument:

```text
/vercel-plugin:deploy prod
```

## Telemetry

Prompt text and bash and tool-call telemetry are not collected.

Telemetry behavior:

- If `VERCEL_PLUGIN_TELEMETRY` is unset, the plugin sends a once-per-day `dau:active_today` event
- `VERCEL_PLUGIN_TELEMETRY=off` disables all telemetry, including the daily active event

To disable telemetry in shells that launch your AI coding tool:

```bash
export VERCEL_PLUGIN_TELEMETRY=off
```

```powershell
setx VERCEL_PLUGIN_TELEMETRY off
```

## Debugging

If the plugin is not behaving as expected, enable debug logging with `VERCEL_PLUGIN_LOG_LEVEL`:

```bash
export VERCEL_PLUGIN_LOG_LEVEL=debug
```

Available log levels:

| Level     | Description                                 |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| `off`     | No logging (default)                        |
| `summary` | High-level injection summaries              |
| `debug`   | Detailed matching and dedup information     |
| `trace`   | Full pipeline traces with timing breakdowns |

You can also run the built-in doctor command:

```bash
npx vercel-plugin doctor
```

The doctor command validates manifest parity, checks hook timeout risk, verifies dedup health, and reports skill map issues.

## Reporting issues

If a skill gives incorrect advice or injection does not fire when expected, file an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/vercel/vercel-plugin/issues). Include:

- What you were building
- What the plugin injected, or did not inject. Enable debug logs with `VERCEL_PLUGIN_LOG_LEVEL=debug`
- What was wrong about it
