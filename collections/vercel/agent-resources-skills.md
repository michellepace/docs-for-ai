# Agent Skills

An agent skill is a packaged capability that extends an AI agent with a specific, production ready behavior such as data access, automation, or domain logic. Skills give agents secure, structured ways to take action across your stack, so they can move beyond chat and reliably execute real workflows. They are modular, composable, and built to plug directly into modern web infrastructure.

Below you'll find the official directory of Vercel published skills. Each skill is verified, documented, and ready to integrate, so you can quickly add powerful new capabilities to your agents and ship faster with confidence.

## Installing skills

Install any skill using the skills CLI:

```bash filename="Terminal"
npx skills add <owner/repo>
```

To install a specific skill from a repository with multiple skills:

```bash filename="Terminal"
npx skills add <owner/repo> --skill <skill-name>
```

Skills work with 18+ AI agents including Claude Code, GitHub Copilot, Cursor, Cline, and many others.

## eve

When you run the skills CLI from an [eve](/docs/eve) project directory, it auto-detects the project and prompts you to install the skills for your eve building agent:

```bash filename="Terminal"
npx skills add <owner/repo>
```

The CLI shows a confirmation prompt:

```text filename="Terminal"
Detected an eve project. Install skills for eve?
● Yes / ○ No
```

Select **Yes** to install the skills into your project's `agent/skills/` directory. Select **No** to install them for your local AI coding agent.
